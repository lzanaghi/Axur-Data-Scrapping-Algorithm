# Axur-Data-Scrapping-Algorithm
ai-axur-scraper-inference is a lightweight Python utility that automates the technical challenge from Axur’s internship assessment. It  scrapes a webpage that contains a Base64-embedded image,  sends the image to microsoft-florence-2-large for a detailed caption, and  submits the raw JSON response to Axur’s validation endpoint.
